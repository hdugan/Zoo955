# 955 basics 

* R verison >= 3.4 
* Recommend RStudio as a code editor 
    * This is what I will use in class 
    * RStudio Desktop 1.1.414 
* Your primary reference will probably be community answers on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com)
* Recommend creating a username and upvoting answers you find helpful

# 955 basics - Homework 

* There will be short weekly assignments 
* Typically I'll ask that you email me your assignments as a pdf 
    * R markdown tutorial 
    * https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/4-rmarkdown.html
    * Or however you'd like to make a pdf

# The spatial basics 

* Commonly used R packages 
    * `library(rgdal)`
    * `library(rgeos)`
    * `library(sp)`
    * `library(maps)`
    * `library(raster)`
    * `library(maptools)`

# Why use R for spatial analysis?
Pros:

* Breadth of statistical packages
* Integration with other data/stats
* Free, easy to access

Cons: 

* Memory limitations 

# Spatial Objects

  |Points |  SpatialPoints      | SpatialPointsDataFrame|
  |Lines |  SpatialLines      | SpatialLinesDataFrame|

# Spatial objects
* Spatial class has two slots
* 1) bounding box, dimension of the plot
* 2) CRS class object defining the coordinate
reference system, and may be set to CRS(as.character(NA)),
its default value.
* Operations on `Spatial` objects should update or copy these
values to the new Spatial objects being created  
  

# SpatialPoints
* The most basic spatial data object is a point, which may have
2 or 3 dimensions
* A single coordinate, or a set of such coordinates, may be used
to define a SpatialPoints object
* The points in a SpatialPoints object may be associated with
a row of attributes to create a SpatialPointsDataFrame object

# Example: SpatialPoints
```{r spoint, echo=T, eval=T}
library(sp)
spoint <- data.frame(y = 43.07, x = -89.40)
summary(spoint)
str(spoint)
coords <- SpatialPoints(spoint)
str(coords)
summary(coords)
```

# SpatialPointsDataFrame
Add data to make a SpatialPointsDataFrame object. 

```{r sdata, echo=T, eval=T}
# library(sp)
sdata <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, data = data.frame(population = 327000))
str(sdata)
summary(sdata)
```

# Spatial Lines & Polygons
* A Line object is a collection of 2D coordinates
* A Polygon object is a Line object with equal first and last
coordinates
* A Lines object is a list of Line objects, such as all the
contours at a single elevation; the same relationship holds
between a Polygons object and a list of Polygon objects, such
as islands belonging to the same county
* SpatialLines and SpatialPolygons objects are made using
lists of Lines or Polygons objects respectively
* SpatialLinesDataFrame and SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
objects are defined using SpatialLines and SpatialPolygons
objects and standard data frames, and the ID fields are here
required to match the data frame row names

# Example: Spatial Polygons
```{r spoly, echo=T, eval=T}
sdata <- data.frame(y = c(43.07,43.10,43.08,43.07), 
                    x = c(-89.40,-89.41,-89.5,089.40))
str(sdata)
spoly <- Polygons(list(Polygon(sdata)), ID = "madison")
summary(spoly)
spolys <- SpatialPolygons(list(spoly))
summary(spolys)
```

# Spatial grids and pixels
* There are two representations for data on regular rectangular
grids (oriented N-S, E-W): `SpatialPixels` and `SpatialGrid`
* SpatialPixels are like SpatialPoints objects, but the
coordinates have to be regularly spaced; the coordinates are
stored, as are grid indices
* SpatialPixelsDataFrame objects only store attribute data
where it is present, but need to store the coordinates and grid
indices of those grid cells
* SpatialGridDataFrame objects do not need to store
coordinates, because they fill the entire defined grid, but they
need to store NA values where attribute values are missing
